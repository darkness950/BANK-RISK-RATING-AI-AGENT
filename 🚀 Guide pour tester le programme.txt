üöÄ Guide to Test the Program
Step 1 ‚Äì Open the Project

Import the project into your IDE (PyCharm, VS Code, etc.).

Set the Python interpreter to Python 3.11 to avoid any compatibility issues.

Step 2 ‚Äì Configure the Groq API Key

For security reasons, the default Groq API key will expire.

Once the key is generated, open the .env file and replace the value of GROQ_API_KEY with your own key.

Step 3 ‚Äì Install Dependencies

Open a terminal in the project environment.

Run the following command to install all required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 4 ‚Äì Launch the Application

Once installation is complete, start the application with:

streamlit run app.py


A browser window will automatically open at http://localhost:8501
.

Step 5 ‚Äì Use the Application

In the left sidebar of the interface:

Upload the CSV dataset of your choice.

Click the Run Full Analysis button to start the complete analysis.
